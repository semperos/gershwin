# Gershwin: Stack-based Clojure #

Gershwin is in early development. Take a look at `src/main/gwn/gershwin/core.gwn` to learn more about the language implementation, or the files under `src/main/java/gershwin/lang/` and `src/main/clj/gershwin` to peruse the parser, compiler, and runtime infrastructure.

## Usage

Build Gershwin:

```
mvn package
```

Run the executable Jar file:

```
java -jar target/gershwin-${version}-executable.jar
```

You can also run a REPL directly:

```
mvn -Prepl test
```

For a better REPL experience, I suggest running it through rlwrap or ledit. My personal ledit incantation looks like this:

```
ledit -x -h ~/.gershwin_repl_history mvn -Prepl test
```
